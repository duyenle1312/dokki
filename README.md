### Welcome to my AI Chatbot a.k.a Dokki


Go to demo folder to discover the example messages between me and Dokki<br /><br />
In the final product, I used GPT3 as the language model.

Before that, I used to train my chatbot on my own dataset. You could find all the Notebook with the AI code I created [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kb-SrijQ5Y63hdDVTA5-oSqCwEguPY33?usp=sharing).<br />

I also added the feature to talk to the bot online using your computer microphone, the interactive notebook can be found in the "Duyen Le Siri" folder inside the link above.

Would appreciate any suggestions to improve it.<br />
